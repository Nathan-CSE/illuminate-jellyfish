# Infinity Jellyfish

This is the repository for the Infinity Jellyfish for UNSW Illuminate. The project was initially created with a PIC microcontroller in mind, however, due to logistics, the team shifted to the use of an Arduino Nano. There are various patterns created by members of the software team that are cycled through continuously.

## Patterns

* Cascading: Syncronised falling effect start at the top of the jellyfish.
* Snowfall: Effects similar to snowflakes falling down.
* Twinkle: Similar to stars twinkling in the night sky.
* Star: LEDs cycle around the jellyfish in a star-like pattern.
* Chase: LEDs chase each other around the grid.
